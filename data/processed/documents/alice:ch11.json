  "text": "The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\narrived, with a great crowd assembled about them -- all sorts of little\nbirds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was\nstanding before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\nhim; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one\nhand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the\ncourt was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so\ngood, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them -- \"I wish they'd\nget the trial done,\" she thought, \"and hand round the refreshments!\"\nBut there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at\neverything about her, to pass away the time.\n\nAlice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read\nabout them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\nthe name of nearly everything there. \"That's the judge,\" she said to\nherself, \"because of his great wig.\"\n\nThe judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the\nwig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he\ndid not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.\n\n\"And that's the jury-box,\" thought Alice, \"and those twelve creatures,\"\n(she was obliged to say \"creatures,\" you see, because some of them were\nanimals, and some were birds,) \"I suppose they are the jurors.\" She\nsaid this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather\nproud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little\ngirls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, \"jury-men\"\nwould have done just as well.\n\nThe twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. \"What are\nthey doing?\" Alice whispered to the Gryphon. \"They can't have anything\nto put down yet, before the trial's begun.\"\n\n\"They're putting down their names,\" the Gryphon whispered in reply,\n\"for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.\"\n\n\"Stupid things!\" Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she\nstopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, \"Silence in the\ncourt!\" and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,\nto make out who was talking.\n\nAlice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\nthat all the jurors were writing down \"stupid things!\" on their slates,\nand she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell\n\"stupid,\" and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. \"A nice\nmuddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!\" thought Alice.\n\nOne of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice\ncould _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and\nvery soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly\nthat the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out\nat all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he\nwas obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this\nwas of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.\n\n\"Herald, read the accusation!\" said the King.\n\nOn this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then\nunrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows: -- \n\n\"The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\n All on a summer day:\nThe Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\n And took them quite away!\"\n\n\n\"Consider your verdict,\" the King said to the jury.\n\n\"Not yet, not yet!\" the Rabbit hastily interrupted. \"There's a great\ndeal to come before that!\"\n\n\"Call the first witness,\" said the King; and the White Rabbit blew\nthree blasts on the trumpet, and called out, \"First witness!\"\n\nThe first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand\nand a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. \"I beg pardon, your\nMajesty,\" he began, \"for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite finished\nmy tea when I was sent for.\"\n\n\"You ought to have finished,\" said the King. \"When did you begin?\"\n\nThe Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the\ncourt, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. \"Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it\nwas,\" he said.\n\n\"Fifteenth,\" said the March Hare.\n\n\"Sixteenth,\" added the Dormouse.\n\n\"Write that down,\" the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly\nwrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and\nreduced the answer to shillings and pence.\n\n\"Take off your hat,\" the King said to the Hatter.\n\n\"It isn't mine,\" said the Hatter.\n\n\"_Stolen!_\" the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made\na memorandum of the fact.\n\n\"I keep them to sell,\" the Hatter added as an explanation; \"I've none\nof my own. I'm a hatter.\"\n\nHere the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,\nwho turned pale and fidgeted.\n\n\"Give your evidence,\" said the King; \"and don't be nervous, or I'll\nhave you executed on the spot.\"\n\nThis did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\nfrom one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his\nconfusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\nbread-and-butter.\n\nJust at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\nher a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\ngrow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\nthe court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was\nas long as there was room for her.\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't squeeze so,\" said the Dormouse, who was sitting\nnext to her. \"I can hardly breathe.\"\n\n\"I can't help it,\" said Alice very meekly: \"I'm growing.\"\n\n\"You've no right to grow _here_,\" said the Dormouse.\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense,\" said Alice more boldly: \"you know you're growing\ntoo.\"\n\n\"Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,\" said the Dormouse: \"not in\nthat ridiculous fashion.\" And he got up very sulkily and crossed over\nto the other side of the court.\n\nAll this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\njust as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\nof the court, \"Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!\"\non which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes\noff.\n\n\"Give your evidence,\" the King repeated angrily, \"or I'll have you\nexecuted, whether you're nervous or not.\"\n\n\"I'm a poor man, your Majesty,\" the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,\n\" -- and I hadn't begun my tea -- not above a week or so -- and what with the\nbread-and-butter getting so thin -- and the twinkling of the tea -- \"\n\n\"The twinkling of the _what?_\" said the King.\n\n\"It _began_ with the tea,\" the Hatter replied.\n\n\"Of course twinkling begins with a T!\" said the King sharply. \"Do you\ntake me for a dunce? Go on!\"\n\n\"I'm a poor man,\" the Hatter went on, \"and most things twinkled after\nthat -- only the March Hare said -- \"\n\n\"I didn't!\" the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\n\n\"You did!\" said the Hatter.\n\n\"I deny it!\" said the March Hare.\n\n\"He denies it,\" said the King: \"leave out that part.\"\n\n\"Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said -- \" the Hatter went on, looking\nanxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\nnothing, being fast asleep.\n\n\"After that,\" continued the Hatter, \"I cut some more bread-and-butter -- \"\n\n\"But what did the Dormouse say?\" one of the jury asked.\n\n\"That I can't remember,\" said the Hatter.\n\n\"You _must_ remember,\" remarked the King, \"or I'll have you executed.\"\n\nThe miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\ndown on one knee. \"I'm a poor man, your Majesty,\" he began.\n\n\"You're a _very_ poor _speaker_,\" said the King.\n\nHere one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\nthe officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just\nexplain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied\nup at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\nhead first, and then sat upon it.)\n\n\"I'm glad I've seen that done,\" thought Alice. \"I've so often read in\nthe newspapers, at the end of trials, \"There was some attempts at\napplause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the\ncourt,\" and I never understood what it meant till now.\"\n\n\"If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,\" continued the\nKing.\n\n\"I can't go no lower,\" said the Hatter: \"I'm on the floor, as it is.\"\n\n\"Then you may _sit_ down,\" the King replied.\n\nHere the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.\n\n\"Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!\" thought Alice. \"Now we shall get\non better.\"\n\n\"I'd rather finish my tea,\" said the Hatter, with an anxious look at\nthe Queen, who was reading the list of singers.\n\n\"You may go,\" said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,\nwithout even waiting to put his shoes on.\n\n\" -- and just take his head off outside,\" the Queen added to one of the\nofficers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get\nto the door.\n\n\"Call the next witness!\" said the King.\n\nThe next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in\nher hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the\ncourt, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.\n\n\"Give your evidence,\" said the King.\n\n\"Shan't,\" said the cook.\n\nThe King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,\n\"Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.\"\n\n\"Well, if I must, I must,\" the King said, with a melancholy air, and,\nafter folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were\nnearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, \"What are tarts made of?\"\n\n\"Pepper, mostly,\" said the cook.\n\n\"Treacle,\" said a sleepy voice behind her.\n\n\"Collar that Dormouse,\" the Queen shrieked out. \"Behead that Dormouse!\nTurn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his\nwhiskers!\"\n\nFor some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse\nturned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had\ndisappeared.\n\n\"Never mind!\" said the King, with an air of great relief. \"Call the\nnext witness.\" And he added in an undertone to the Queen, \"Really, my\ndear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my\nforehead ache!\"\n\nAlice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling\nvery curious to see what the next witness would be like, \" -- for they\nhaven't got much evidence _yet_,\" she said to herself. Imagine her\nsurprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill\nlittle voice, the name \"Alice!\""
