  "text": "For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\nto do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\nwood -- (she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\notherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\nfish) -- and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by\nanother footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\nfrog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled\nall over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all\nabout, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\n\nThe Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\nnearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\nsaying, in a solemn tone, \"For the Duchess. An invitation from the\nQueen to play croquet.\" The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn\ntone, only changing the order of the words a little, \"From the Queen.\nAn invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\"\n\nThen they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\n\nAlice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood\nfor fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\nFish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\ndoor, staring stupidly up into the sky.\n\nAlice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\n\n\"There's no sort of use in knocking,\" said the Footman, \"and that for\ntwo reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you\nare; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could\npossibly hear you.\" And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary\nnoise going on within -- a constant howling and sneezing, and every now\nand then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to\npieces.\n\n\"Please, then,\" said Alice, \"how am I to get in?\"\n\n\"There might be some sense in your knocking,\" the Footman went on\nwithout attending to her, \"if we had the door between us. For instance,\nif you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you\nknow.\" He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and\nthis Alice thought decidedly uncivil. \"But perhaps he can't help it,\"\nshe said to herself; \"his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his\nhead. But at any rate he might answer questions. -- How am I to get in?\"\nshe repeated, aloud.\n\n\"I shall sit here,\" the Footman remarked, \"till tomorrow -- \"\n\nAt this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\nskimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his nose,\nand broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\n\n\" -- or next day, maybe,\" the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\nas if nothing had happened.\n\n\"How am I to get in?\" asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\n\n\"_Are_ you to get in at all?\" said the Footman. \"That's the first\nquestion, you know.\"\n\nIt was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. \"It's really\ndreadful,\" she muttered to herself, \"the way all the creatures argue.\nIt's enough to drive one crazy!\"\n\nThe Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\nremark, with variations. \"I shall sit here,\" he said, \"on and off, for\ndays and days.\"\n\n\"But what am _I_ to do?\" said Alice.\n\n\"Anything you like,\" said the Footman, and began whistling.\n\n\"Oh, there's no use in talking to him,\" said Alice desperately: \"he's\nperfectly idiotic!\" And she opened the door and went in.\n\nThe door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\none end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool\nin the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,\nstirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\n\n\"There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!\" Alice said to\nherself, as well as she could for sneezing.\n\nThere was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed\noccasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\nalternately without a moment's pause. The only things in the kitchen\nthat did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting\non the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\n\n\"Please would you tell me,\" said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\nnot quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, \"why\nyour cat grins like that?\"\n\n\"It's a Cheshire cat,\" said the Duchess, \"and that's why. Pig!\"\n\nShe said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\njumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the\nbaby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again: -- \n\n\"I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't\nknow that cats _could_ grin.\"\n\n\"They all can,\" said the Duchess; \"and most of 'em do.\"\n\n\"I don't know of any that do,\" Alice said very politely, feeling quite\npleased to have got into a conversation.\n\n\"You don't know much,\" said the Duchess; \"and that's a fact.\"\n\nAlice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\nbe as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\nwas trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\nfire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\nthe Duchess and the baby -- the fire-irons came first; then followed a\nshower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\nthem even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\nthat it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\n\n\"Oh, _please_ mind what you're doing!\" cried Alice, jumping up and down\nin an agony of terror. \"Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!\" as an\nunusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it\noff.\n\n\"If everybody minded their own business,\" the Duchess said in a hoarse\ngrowl, \"the world would go round a deal faster than it does.\"\n\n\"Which would _not_ be an advantage,\" said Alice, who felt very glad to\nget an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. \"Just\nthink of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the\nearth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis -- \"\n\n\"Talking of axes,\" said the Duchess, \"chop off her head!\"\n\nAlice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\nthe hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\nbe listening, so she went on again: \"Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or\nis it twelve? I -- \"\n\n\"Oh, don't bother _me_,\" said the Duchess; \"I never could abide\nfigures!\" And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a\nsort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at\nthe end of every line:\n\n\"Speak roughly to your little boy,\n And beat him when he sneezes:\nHe only does it to annoy,\n Because he knows it teases.\"\n\n\nCHORUS.\n(In which the cook and the baby joined):\n\n\n\"Wow! wow! wow!\"\n\n\nWhile the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\nthe baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\nthat Alice could hardly hear the words: -- \n\n\"I speak severely to my boy,\n I beat him when he sneezes;\nFor he can thoroughly enjoy\n The pepper when he pleases!\"\n\n\nCHORUS.\n\n\n\"Wow! wow! wow!\"\n\n\n\"Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!\" the Duchess said to Alice,\nflinging the baby at her as she spoke. \"I must go and get ready to play\ncroquet with the Queen,\" and she hurried out of the room. The cook\nthrew a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.\n\nAlice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\nlittle creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,\n\"just like a star-fish,\" thought Alice. The poor little thing was\nsnorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling\nitself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for\nthe first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.\n\nAs soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to\ntwist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\near and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it\nout into the open air. \"If I don't take this child away with me,\"\nthought Alice, \"they're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be\nmurder to leave it behind?\" She said the last words out loud, and the\nlittle thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).\n\"Don't grunt,\" said Alice; \"that's not at all a proper way of\nexpressing yourself.\"\n\nThe baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face\nto see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had\na _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also\nits eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did\nnot like the look of the thing at all. \"But perhaps it was only\nsobbing,\" she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there\nwere any tears.\n\nNo, there were no tears. \"If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,\"\nsaid Alice, seriously, \"I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind\nnow!\" The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\nto say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\n\nAlice was just beginning to think to herself, \"Now, what am I to do\nwith this creature when I get it home?\" when it grunted again, so\nviolently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time\nthere could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than\na pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it\nfurther.\n\nSo she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it\ntrot away quietly into the wood. \"If it had grown up,\" she said to\nherself, \"it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\nrather a handsome pig, I think.\" And she began thinking over other\nchildren she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\nto herself, \"if one only knew the right way to change them -- \" when she\nwas a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of\na tree a few yards off.\n\nThe Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she\nthought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she\nfelt that it ought to be treated with respect.\n\n\"Cheshire Puss,\" she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\nwhether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little\nwider. \"Come, it's pleased so far,\" thought Alice, and she went on.\n\"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?\"\n\n\"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,\" said the Cat.\n\n\"I don't much care where -- \" said Alice.\n\n\"Then it doesn't matter which way you go,\" said the Cat.\n\n\" -- so long as I get _somewhere_,\" Alice added as an explanation.\n\n\"Oh, you're sure to do that,\" said the Cat, \"if you only walk long\nenough.\"\n\nAlice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another\nquestion. \"What sort of people live about here?\"\n\n\"In _that_ direction,\" the Cat said, waving its right paw round, \"lives\na Hatter: and in _that_ direction,\" waving the other paw, \"lives a\nMarch Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.\"\n\n\"But I don't want to go among mad people,\" Alice remarked.\n\n\"Oh, you can't help that,\" said the Cat: \"we're all mad here. I'm mad.\nYou're mad.\"\n\n\"How do you know I'm mad?\" said Alice.\n\n\"You must be,\" said the Cat, \"or you wouldn't have come here.\"\n\nAlice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on \"And how\ndo you know that you're mad?\"\n\n\"To begin with,\" said the Cat, \"a dog's not mad. You grant that?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" said Alice.\n\n\"Well, then,\" the Cat went on, \"you see, a dog growls when it's angry,\nand wags its tail when it's pleased. Now _I_ growl when I'm pleased,\nand wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.\"\n\n\"_I_ call it purring, not growling,\" said Alice.\n\n\"Call it what you like,\" said the Cat. \"Do you play croquet with the\nQueen to-day?\"\n\n\"I should like it very much,\" said Alice, \"but I haven't been invited\nyet.\"\n\n\"You'll see me there,\" said the Cat, and vanished.\n\nAlice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\nthings happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,\nit suddenly appeared again.\n\n\"By-the-bye, what became of the baby?\" said the Cat. \"I'd nearly\nforgotten to ask.\"\n\n\"It turned into a pig,\" Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back\nin a natural way.\n\n\"I thought it would,\" said the Cat, and vanished again.\n\nAlice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\nappear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\nwhich the March Hare was said to live. \"I've seen hatters before,\" she\nsaid to herself; \"the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\nperhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad -- at least not so mad as it\nwas in March.\" As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat\nagain, sitting on a branch of a tree.\n\n\"Did you say pig, or fig?\" said the Cat.\n\n\"I said pig,\" replied Alice; \"and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing\nand vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\nbeginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\nremained some time after the rest of it had gone.\n\n\"Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,\" thought Alice; \"but a\ngrin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!\"\n\nShe had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of\nthe March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\nchimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It\nwas so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\nnibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself\nto about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather\ntimidly, saying to herself \"Suppose it should be raving mad after all!\nI almost wish I'd gone to see the Hatter instead!\""
