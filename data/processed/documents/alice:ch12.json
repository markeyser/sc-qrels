  "text": "\"Here!\" cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how\nlarge she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such\na hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,\nupsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there\nthey lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of\ngoldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.\n\n\"Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!\" she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and\nbegan picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident\nof the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of\nidea that they must be collected at once and put back into the\njury-box, or they would die.\n\n\"The trial cannot proceed,\" said the King in a very grave voice, \"until\nall the jurymen are back in their proper places -- _all_,\" he repeated\nwith great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.\n\nAlice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put\nthe Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its\ntail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon\ngot it out again, and put it right; \"not that it signifies much,\" she\nsaid to herself; \"I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the\ntrial one way up as the other.\"\n\nAs soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\nupset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\nthem, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\naccident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do\nanything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\ncourt.\n\n\"What do you know about this business?\" the King said to Alice.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Alice.\n\n\"Nothing _whatever?_\" persisted the King.\n\n\"Nothing whatever,\" said Alice.\n\n\"That's very important,\" the King said, turning to the jury. They were\njust beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White\nRabbit interrupted: \"_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,\" he\nsaid in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as\nhe spoke.\n\n\"_Un_important, of course, I meant,\" the King hastily said, and went on\nto himself in an undertone,\n\n\"important -- unimportant -- unimportant -- important -- \" as if he were trying\nwhich word sounded best.\n\nSome of the jury wrote it down \"important,\" and some \"unimportant.\"\nAlice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;\n\"but it doesn't matter a bit,\" she thought to herself.\n\nAt this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in\nhis note-book, cackled out \"Silence!\" and read out from his book, \"Rule\nForty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.\"\n\nEverybody looked at Alice.\n\n\"_I'm_ not a mile high,\" said Alice.\n\n\"You are,\" said the King.\n\n\"Nearly two miles high,\" added the Queen.\n\n\"Well, I shan't go, at any rate,\" said Alice: \"besides, that's not a\nregular rule: you invented it just now.\"\n\n\"It's the oldest rule in the book,\" said the King.\n\n\"Then it ought to be Number One,\" said Alice.\n\nThe King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. \"Consider your\nverdict,\" he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.\n\n\"There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,\" said the\nWhite Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; \"this paper has just been\npicked up.\"\n\n\"What's in it?\" said the Queen.\n\n\"I haven't opened it yet,\" said the White Rabbit, \"but it seems to be a\nletter, written by the prisoner to -- to somebody.\"\n\n\"It must have been that,\" said the King, \"unless it was written to\nnobody, which isn't usual, you know.\"\n\n\"Who is it directed to?\" said one of the jurymen.\n\n\"It isn't directed at all,\" said the White Rabbit; \"in fact, there's\nnothing written on the _outside_.\" He unfolded the paper as he spoke,\nand added \"It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses.\"\n\n\"Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?\" asked another of the jurymen.\n\n\"No, they're not,\" said the White Rabbit, \"and that's the queerest\nthing about it.\" (The jury all looked puzzled.)\n\n\"He must have imitated somebody else's hand,\" said the King. (The jury\nall brightened up again.)\n\n\"Please your Majesty,\" said the Knave, \"I didn't write it, and they\ncan't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.\"\n\n\"If you didn't sign it,\" said the King, \"that only makes the matter\nworse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed\nyour name like an honest man.\"\n\nThere was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really\nclever thing the King had said that day.\n\n\"That _proves_ his guilt,\" said the Queen.\n\n\"It proves nothing of the sort!\" said Alice. \"Why, you don't even know\nwhat they're about!\"\n\n\"Read them,\" said the King.\n\nThe White Rabbit put on his spectacles. \"Where shall I begin, please\nyour Majesty?\" he asked.\n\n\"Begin at the beginning,\" the King said gravely, \"and go on till you\ncome to the end: then stop.\"\n\nThese were the verses the White Rabbit read: -- \n\n\"They told me you had been to her,\n And mentioned me to him:\nShe gave me a good character,\n But said I could not swim.\n\nHe sent them word I had not gone\n (We know it to be true):\nIf she should push the matter on,\n What would become of you?\n\nI gave her one, they gave him two,\n You gave us three or more;\nThey all returned from him to you,\n Though they were mine before.\n\nIf I or she should chance to be\n Involved in this affair,\nHe trusts to you to set them free,\n Exactly as we were.\n\nMy notion was that you had been\n (Before she had this fit)\nAn obstacle that came between\n Him, and ourselves, and it.\n\nDon't let him know she liked them best,\n For this must ever be\nA secret, kept from all the rest,\n Between yourself and me.\"\n\n\n\"That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,\" said the\nKing, rubbing his hands; \"so now let the jury -- \"\n\n\"If any one of them can explain it,\" said Alice, (she had grown so\nlarge in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of\ninterrupting him,) \"I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't believe there's\nan atom of meaning in it.\"\n\nThe jury all wrote down on their slates, \"_She_ doesn't believe there's\nan atom of meaning in it,\" but none of them attempted to explain the\npaper.\n\n\"If there's no meaning in it,\" said the King, \"that saves a world of\ntrouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't\nknow,\" he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at\nthem with one eye; \"I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.\n\" -- _said I could not swim_ -- \" you can't swim, can you?\" he added, turning\nto the Knave.\n\nThe Knave shook his head sadly. \"Do I look like it?\" he said. (Which he\ncertainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)\n\n\"All right, so far,\" said the King, and he went on muttering over the\nverses to himself: \"'_We know it to be true_ -- ' that's the jury, of\ncourse -- '_I gave her one, they gave him two_ -- ' why, that must be what he\ndid with the tarts, you know -- \"\n\n\"But, it goes on '_they all returned from him to you_,'\" said Alice.\n\n\"Why, there they are!\" said the King triumphantly, pointing to the\ntarts on the table. \"Nothing can be clearer than _that_. Then\nagain -- '_before she had this fit_ -- ' you never had fits, my dear, I\nthink?\" he said to the Queen.\n\n\"Never!\" said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard\nas she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his\nslate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily\nbegan again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long\nas it lasted.)\n\n\"Then the words don't _fit_ you,\" said the King, looking round the\ncourt with a smile. There was a dead silence.\n\n\"It's a pun!\" the King added in an offended tone, and everybody\nlaughed, \"Let the jury consider their verdict,\" the King said, for\nabout the twentieth time that day.\n\n\"No, no!\" said the Queen. \"Sentence first -- verdict afterwards.\"\n\n\"Stuff and nonsense!\" said Alice loudly. \"The idea of having the\nsentence first!\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue!\" said the Queen, turning purple.\n\n\"I won't!\" said Alice.\n\n\"Off with her head!\" the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody\nmoved.\n\n\"Who cares for you?\" said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by\nthis time.) \"You're nothing but a pack of cards!\"\n\nAt this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\nher: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\ntried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\nhead in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\nleaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.\n\n\"Wake up, Alice dear!\" said her sister; \"Why, what a long sleep you've\nhad!\"\n\n\"Oh, I've had such a curious dream!\" said Alice, and she told her\nsister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange\nAdventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she\nhad finished, her sister kissed her, and said, \"It _was_ a curious\ndream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.\"\nSo Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,\nwhat a wonderful dream it had been.\n\n\nBut her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\nhand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all\nher wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,\nand this was her dream: -- \n\nFirst, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\nhands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were\nlooking up into hers -- she could hear the very tones of her voice, and\nsee that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair\nthat _would_ always get into her eyes -- and still as she listened, or\nseemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the\nstrange creatures of her little sister's dream.\n\nThe long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by -- the\nfrightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool -- she\ncould hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\nshared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\nordering off her unfortunate guests to execution -- once more the pig-baby\nwas sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed\naround it -- once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\nLizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\nfilled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\nTurtle.\n\nSo she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\nWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\nwould change to dull reality -- the grass would be only rustling in the\nwind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds -- the rattling\nteacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill\ncries to the voice of the shepherd boy -- and the sneeze of the baby, the\nshriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change\n(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard -- while the\nlowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock\nTurtle's heavy sobs.\n\nLastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\nwould, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\nkeep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\nchildhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,\nand make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,\nperhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she\nwould feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all\ntheir simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer\ndays."
