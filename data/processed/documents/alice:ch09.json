  "text": "\"You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!\"\nsaid the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's,\nand they walked off together.\n\nAlice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought\nto herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so\nsavage when they met in the kitchen.\n\n\"When _I'm_ a Duchess,\" she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful\ntone though), \"I won't have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup\ndoes very well without -- Maybe it's always pepper that makes people\nhot-tempered,\" she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new\nkind of rule, \"and vinegar that makes them sour -- and camomile that makes\nthem bitter -- and -- and barley-sugar and such things that make children\nsweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn't be\nso stingy about it, you know -- \"\n\nShe had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\nstartled when she heard her voice close to her ear. \"You're thinking\nabout something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can't\ntell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in\na bit.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it hasn't one,\" Alice ventured to remark.\n\n\"Tut, tut, child!\" said the Duchess. \"Everything's got a moral, if only\nyou can find it.\" And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as\nshe spoke.\n\nAlice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\nDuchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the\nright height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder, and it was an\nuncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she\nbore it as well as she could.\n\n\"The game's going on rather better now,\" she said, by way of keeping up\nthe conversation a little.\n\n\"'Tis so,\" said the Duchess: \"and the moral of that is -- 'Oh, 'tis love,\n'tis love, that makes the world go round!'\"\n\n\"Somebody said,\" Alice whispered, \"that it's done by everybody minding\ntheir own business!\"\n\n\"Ah, well! It means much the same thing,\" said the Duchess, digging her\nsharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added, \"and the moral of\n_that_ is -- 'Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of\nthemselves.'\"\n\n\"How fond she is of finding morals in things!\" Alice thought to\nherself.\n\n\"I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist,\"\nthe Duchess said after a pause: \"the reason is, that I'm doubtful about\nthe temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?\"\n\n\"He might bite,\" Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious\nto have the experiment tried.\n\n\"Very true,\" said the Duchess: \"flamingoes and mustard both bite. And\nthe moral of that is -- 'Birds of a feather flock together.'\"\n\n\"Only mustard isn't a bird,\" Alice remarked.\n\n\"Right, as usual,\" said the Duchess: \"what a clear way you have of\nputting things!\"\n\n\"It's a mineral, I _think_,\" said Alice.\n\n\"Of course it is,\" said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\neverything that Alice said; \"there's a large mustard-mine near here.\nAnd the moral of that is -- 'The more there is of mine, the less there is\nof yours.'\"\n\n\"Oh, I know!\" exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last\nremark, \"it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it is.\"\n\n\"I quite agree with you,\" said the Duchess; \"and the moral of that\nis -- 'Be what you would seem to be' -- or if you'd like it put more\nsimply -- 'Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\nappear to others that what you were or might have been was not\notherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be\notherwise.'\"\n\n\"I think I should understand that better,\" Alice said very politely,\n\"if I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it.\"\n\n\"That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,\" the Duchess replied,\nin a pleased tone.\n\n\"Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,\" said\nAlice.\n\n\"Oh, don't talk about trouble!\" said the Duchess. \"I make you a present\nof everything I've said as yet.\"\n\n\"A cheap sort of present!\" thought Alice. \"I'm glad they don't give\nbirthday presents like that!\" But she did not venture to say it out\nloud.\n\n\"Thinking again?\" the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\nlittle chin.\n\n\"I've a right to think,\" said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to\nfeel a little worried.\n\n\"Just about as much right,\" said the Duchess, \"as pigs have to fly; and\nthe m -- \"\n\nBut here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away,\neven in the middle of her favourite word 'moral,' and the arm that was\nlinked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the\nQueen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a\nthunderstorm.\n\n\"A fine day, your Majesty!\" the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.\n\n\"Now, I give you fair warning,\" shouted the Queen, stamping on the\nground as she spoke; \"either you or your head must be off, and that in\nabout half no time! Take your choice!\"\n\nThe Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\n\n\"Let's go on with the game,\" the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too\nmuch frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\ncroquet-ground.\n\nThe other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, and were\nresting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried\nback to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay\nwould cost them their lives.\n\nAll the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling\nwith the other players, and shouting \"Off with his head!\" or \"Off with\nher head!\" Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the\nsoldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so\nthat by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and\nall the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody\nand under sentence of execution.\n\nThen the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, \"Have\nyou seen the Mock Turtle yet?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Alice. \"I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.\"\n\n\"It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,\" said the Queen.\n\n\"I never saw one, or heard of one,\" said Alice.\n\n\"Come on, then,\" said the Queen, \"and he shall tell you his history.\"\n\nAs they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,\nto the company generally, \"You are all pardoned.\" \"Come, _that's_ a\ngood thing!\" she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the\nnumber of executions the Queen had ordered.\n\nThey very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If\nyou don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) \"Up, lazy\nthing!\" said the Queen, \"and take this young lady to see the Mock\nTurtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some\nexecutions I have ordered;\" and she walked off, leaving Alice alone\nwith the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,\nbut on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it\nas to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.\n\nThe Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till\nshe was out of sight: then it chuckled. \"What fun!\" said the Gryphon,\nhalf to itself, half to Alice.\n\n\"What _is_ the fun?\" said Alice.\n\n\"Why, _she_,\" said the Gryphon. \"It's all her fancy, that: they never\nexecutes nobody, you know. Come on!\"\n\n\"Everybody says 'come on!' here,\" thought Alice, as she went slowly\nafter it: \"I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!\"\n\nThey had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\nsitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\nnearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She\npitied him deeply. \"What is his sorrow?\" she asked the Gryphon, and the\nGryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, \"It's all\nhis fancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know. Come on!\"\n\nSo they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\nfull of tears, but said nothing.\n\n\"This here young lady,\" said the Gryphon, \"she wants for to know your\nhistory, she do.\"\n\n\"I'll tell it her,\" said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: \"sit\ndown, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.\"\n\nSo they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to\nherself, \"I don't see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn't begin.\"\nBut she waited patiently.\n\n\"Once,\" said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, \"I was a real\nTurtle.\"\n\nThese words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\noccasional exclamation of \"Hjckrrh!\" from the Gryphon, and the constant\nheavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and\nsaying, \"Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,\" but she could not\nhelp thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said\nnothing.\n\n\"When we were little,\" the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\nthough still sobbing a little now and then, \"we went to school in the\nsea. The master was an old Turtle -- we used to call him Tortoise -- \"\n\n\"Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?\" Alice asked.\n\n\"We called him Tortoise because he taught us,\" said the Mock Turtle\nangrily: \"really you are very dull!\"\n\n\"You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple\nquestion,\" added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked\nat poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the\nGryphon said to the Mock Turtle, \"Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all\nday about it!\" and he went on in these words:\n\n\"Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it -- \"\n\n\"I never said I didn't!\" interrupted Alice.\n\n\"You did,\" said the Mock Turtle.\n\n\"Hold your tongue!\" added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.\nThe Mock Turtle went on.\n\n\"We had the best of educations -- in fact, we went to school every day -- \"\n\n\"_I've_ been to a day-school, too,\" said Alice; \"you needn't be so\nproud as all that.\"\n\n\"With extras?\" asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Alice, \"we learned French and music.\"\n\n\"And washing?\" said the Mock Turtle.\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Alice indignantly.\n\n\"Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,\" said the Mock Turtle in a\ntone of great relief. \"Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,\n'French, music, _and washing_ -- extra.'\"\n\n\"You couldn't have wanted it much,\" said Alice; \"living at the bottom\nof the sea.\"\n\n\"I couldn't afford to learn it.\" said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. \"I\nonly took the regular course.\"\n\n\"What was that?\" inquired Alice.\n\n\"Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,\" the Mock Turtle\nreplied; \"and then the different branches of Arithmetic -- Ambition,\nDistraction, Uglification, and Derision.\"\n\n\"I never heard of 'Uglification,'\" Alice ventured to say. \"What is it?\"\n\nThe Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. \"What! Never heard of\nuglifying!\" it exclaimed. \"You know what to beautify is, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Alice doubtfully: \"it means -- to -- make -- anything -- prettier.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" the Gryphon went on, \"if you don't know what to uglify\nis, you _are_ a simpleton.\"\n\nAlice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so\nshe turned to the Mock Turtle, and said \"What else had you to learn?\"\n\n\"Well, there was Mystery,\" the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the\nsubjects on his flappers, \" -- Mystery, ancient and modern, with\nSeaography: then Drawling -- the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,\nthat used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and\nFainting in Coils.\"\n\n\"What was _that_ like?\" said Alice.\n\n\"Well, I can't show it you myself,\" the Mock Turtle said: \"I'm too\nstiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.\"\n\n\"Hadn't time,\" said the Gryphon: \"I went to the Classics master,\nthough. He was an old crab, _he_ was.\"\n\n\"I never went to him,\" the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: \"he taught\nLaughing and Grief, they used to say.\"\n\n\"So he did, so he did,\" said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both\ncreatures hid their faces in their paws.\n\n\"And how many hours a day did you do lessons?\" said Alice, in a hurry\nto change the subject.\n\n\"Ten hours the first day,\" said the Mock Turtle: \"nine the next, and so\non.\"\n\n\"What a curious plan!\" exclaimed Alice.\n\n\"That's the reason they're called lessons,\" the Gryphon remarked:\n\"because they lessen from day to day.\"\n\nThis was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little\nbefore she made her next remark. \"Then the eleventh day must have been\na holiday?\"\n\n\"Of course it was,\" said the Mock Turtle.\n\n\"And how did you manage on the twelfth?\" Alice went on eagerly.\n\n\"That's enough about lessons,\" the Gryphon interrupted in a very\ndecided tone: \"tell her something about the games now.\""
