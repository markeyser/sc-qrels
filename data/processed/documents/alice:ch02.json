  "text": "\"Curiouser and curiouser!\" cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); \"now I'm\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!\"\n(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\nsight, they were getting so far off). \"Oh, my poor little feet, I\nwonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm\nsure _I_ shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\nmyself about you: you must manage the best way you can; -- but I must be\nkind to them,\" thought Alice, \"or perhaps they won't walk the way I\nwant to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every\nChristmas.\"\n\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. \"They must\ngo by the carrier,\" she thought; \"and how funny it'll seem, sending\npresents to one's own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\n\n _Alice's Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with\n Alice's love_).\n\nOh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!\"\n\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was\nnow more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden\nkey and hurried off to the garden door.\n\nPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\nhopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.\n\n\"You ought to be ashamed of yourself,\" said Alice, \"a great girl like\nyou,\" (she might well say this), \"to go on crying in this way! Stop\nthis moment, I tell you!\" But she went on all the same, shedding\ngallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about\nfour inches deep and reaching half down the hall.\n\nAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White\nRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves\nin one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a\ngreat hurry, muttering to himself as he came, \"Oh! the Duchess, the\nDuchess! Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!\" Alice felt\nso desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the\nRabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, \"If you please,\nsir -- \" The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and\nthe fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\n\nAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\nkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: \"Dear, dear! How\nqueer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.\nI wonder if I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the\nsame when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling\na little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who\nin the world am I? Ah, _that's_ the great puzzle!\" And she began\nthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as\nherself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.\n\n\"I'm sure I'm not Ada,\" she said, \"for her hair goes in such long\nringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't\nbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a\nvery little! Besides, _she's_ she, and _I'm_ I, and -- oh dear, how\npuzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know.\nLet me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,\nand four times seven is -- oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that\nrate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try\nGeography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of\nRome, and Rome -- no, _that's_ all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been\nchanged for Mabel! I'll try and say '_How doth the little_ -- '\" and she\ncrossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began\nto repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words\ndid not come the same as they used to do: -- \n\n\"How doth the little crocodile\n Improve his shining tail,\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\n On every golden scale!\n\n\"How cheerfully he seems to grin,\n How neatly spread his claws,\nAnd welcome little fishes in\n With gently smiling jaws!\"\n\n\n\"I'm sure those are not the right words,\" said poor Alice, and her eyes\nfilled with tears again as she went on, \"I must be Mabel after all, and\nI shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\nno toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I've\nmade up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be\nno use their putting their heads down and saying 'Come up again, dear!'\nI shall only look up and say 'Who am I then? Tell me that first, and\nthen, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down\nhere till I'm somebody else' -- but, oh dear!\" cried Alice, with a sudden\nburst of tears, \"I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so\n_very_ tired of being all alone here!\"\n\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\nthat she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while\nshe was talking. \"How _can_ I have done that?\" she thought. \"I must be\ngrowing small again.\" She got up and went to the table to measure\nherself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was\nnow about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon\nfound out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she\ndropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\n\n\"That _was_ a narrow escape!\" said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\nsudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; \"and\nnow for the garden!\" and she ran with all speed back to the little\ndoor: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden\nkey was lying on the glass table as before, \"and things are worse than\never,\" thought the poor child, \"for I never was so small as this\nbefore, never! And I declare it's too bad, that it is!\"\n\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,\nsplash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that\nshe had somehow fallen into the sea, \"and in that case I can go back by\nrailway,\" she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\nher life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\nto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\nsea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\nof lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she\nsoon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\nshe was nine feet high.\n\n\"I wish I hadn't cried so much!\" said Alice, as she swam about, trying\nto find her way out. \"I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\nbeing drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be\nsure! However, everything is queer to-day.\"\n\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\noff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\nit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\nshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\nslipped in like herself.\n\n\"Would it be of any use, now,\" thought Alice, \"to speak to this mouse?\nEverything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\nlikely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.\" So she\nbegan: \"O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!\" (Alice thought this must be the right\nway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\nshe remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, \"A mouse -- of\na mouse -- to a mouse -- a mouse -- O mouse!\") The Mouse looked at her rather\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\nbut it said nothing.\n\n\"Perhaps it doesn't understand English,\" thought Alice; \"I daresay it's\na French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\" (For, with all\nher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\nanything had happened.) So she began again: \"OÃ¹ est ma chatte?\" which\nwas the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\nsudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\nfright. \"Oh, I beg your pardon!\" cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\nhad hurt the poor animal's feelings. \"I quite forgot you didn't like\ncats.\"\n\n\"Not like cats!\" cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. \"Would\n_you_ like cats if you were me?\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps not,\" said Alice in a soothing tone: \"don't be angry\nabout it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd\ntake a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear\nquiet thing,\" Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\nin the pool, \"and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\npaws and washing her face -- and she is such a nice soft thing to\nnurse -- and she's such a capital one for catching mice -- oh, I beg your\npardon!\" cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\nover, and she felt certain it must be really offended. \"We won't talk\nabout her any more if you'd rather not.\"\n\n\"We indeed!\" cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\ntail. \"As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always\n_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name\nagain!\"\n\n\"I won't indeed!\" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\nconversation. \"Are you -- are you fond -- of -- of dogs?\" The Mouse did not\nanswer, so Alice went on eagerly: \"There is such a nice little dog near\nour house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\nknow, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when\nyou throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\nof things -- I can't remember half of them -- and it belongs to a farmer, you\nknow, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He says\nit kills all the rats and -- oh dear!\" cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,\n\"I'm afraid I've offended it again!\" For the Mouse was swimming away\nfrom her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the\npool as it went.\n\nSo she called softly after it, \"Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\nwon't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!\" When the\nMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face\nwas quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\ntrembling voice, \"Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my\nhistory, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\"\n\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\nbirds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a\nDodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice\nled the way, and the whole party swam to the shore."
