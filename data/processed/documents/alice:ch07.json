  "text": "There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\nMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\nbetween them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\ncushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. \"Very\nuncomfortable for the Dormouse,\" thought Alice; \"only, as it's asleep,\nI suppose it doesn't mind.\"\n\nThe table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\none corner of it: \"No room! No room!\" they cried out when they saw\nAlice coming. \"There's _plenty_ of room!\" said Alice indignantly, and\nshe sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\n\n\"Have some wine,\" the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\n\nAlice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.\n\"I don't see any wine,\" she remarked.\n\n\"There isn't any,\" said the March Hare.\n\n\"Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,\" said Alice angrily.\n\n\"It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,\" said\nthe March Hare.\n\n\"I didn't know it was _your_ table,\" said Alice; \"it's laid for a great\nmany more than three.\"\n\n\"Your hair wants cutting,\" said the Hatter. He had been looking at\nAlice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first\nspeech.\n\n\"You should learn not to make personal remarks,\" Alice said with some\nseverity; \"it's very rude.\"\n\nThe Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_\nwas, \"Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\"\n\n\"Come, we shall have some fun now!\" thought Alice. \"I'm glad they've\nbegun asking riddles. -- I believe I can guess that,\" she added aloud.\n\n\"Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?\" said\nthe March Hare.\n\n\"Exactly so,\" said Alice.\n\n\"Then you should say what you mean,\" the March Hare went on.\n\n\"I do,\" Alice hastily replied; \"at least -- at least I mean what I\nsay -- that's the same thing, you know.\"\n\n\"Not the same thing a bit!\" said the Hatter. \"You might just as well\nsay that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I see'!\"\n\n\"You might just as well say,\" added the March Hare, \"that 'I like what\nI get' is the same thing as 'I get what I like'!\"\n\n\"You might just as well say,\" added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\ntalking in his sleep, \"that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing\nas 'I sleep when I breathe'!\"\n\n\"It _is_ the same thing with you,\" said the Hatter, and here the\nconversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while\nAlice thought over all she could remember about ravens and\nwriting-desks, which wasn't much.\n\nThe Hatter was the first to break the silence. \"What day of the month\nis it?\" he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\npocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\nand holding it to his ear.\n\nAlice considered a little, and then said \"The fourth.\"\n\n\"Two days wrong!\" sighed the Hatter. \"I told you butter wouldn't suit\nthe works!\" he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\n\n\"It was the _best_ butter,\" the March Hare meekly replied.\n\n\"Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,\" the Hatter grumbled:\n\"you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.\"\n\nThe March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\nit into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\nnothing better to say than his first remark, \"It was the _best_ butter,\nyou know.\"\n\nAlice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. \"What a\nfunny watch!\" she remarked. \"It tells the day of the month, and doesn't\ntell what o'clock it is!\"\n\n\"Why should it?\" muttered the Hatter. \"Does _your_ watch tell you what\nyear it is?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" Alice replied very readily: \"but that's because it\nstays the same year for such a long time together.\"\n\n\"Which is just the case with _mine_,\" said the Hatter.\n\nAlice felt dreadfully puzzled, The Hatter's remark seemed to have no\nsort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. \"I don't quite\nunderstand you,\" she said, as politely as she could.\n\n\"The Dormouse is asleep again,\" said the Hatter, and he poured a little\nhot tea upon its nose.\n\nThe Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\neyes, \"Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.\"\n\n\"Have you guessed the riddle yet?\" the Hatter said, turning to Alice\nagain.\n\n\"No, I give it up,\" Alice replied: \"what's the answer?\"\n\n\"I haven't the slightest idea,\" said the Hatter.\n\n\"Nor I,\" said the March Hare.\n\nAlice sighed wearily. \"I think you might do something better with the\ntime,\" she said, \"than waste it in asking riddles that have no\nanswers.\"\n\n\"If you knew Time as well as I do,\" said the Hatter, \"you wouldn't talk\nabout wasting _it_. It's _him_.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" said Alice.\n\n\"Of course you don't!\" the Hatter said, tossing his head\ncontemptuously. \"I dare say you never even spoke to Time!\"\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" Alice cautiously replied: \"but I know I have to beat\ntime when I learn music.\"\n\n\"Ah! that accounts for it,\" said the Hatter. \"He won't stand beating.\nNow, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything\nyou liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in\nthe morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a\nhint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\ntime for dinner!\"\n\n(\"I only wish it was,\" the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\n\n\"That would be grand, certainly,\" said Alice thoughtfully: \"but then -- I\nshouldn't be hungry for it, you know.\"\n\n\"Not at first, perhaps,\" said the Hatter: \"but you could keep it to\nhalf-past one as long as you liked.\"\n\n\"Is that the way _you_ manage?\" Alice asked.\n\nThe Hatter shook his head mournfully. \"Not I!\" he replied. \"We\nquarrelled last March -- just before _he_ went mad, you know -- \" (pointing\nwith his tea spoon at the March Hare,) \" -- it was at the great concert\ngiven by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\n\n'Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\nHow I wonder what you're at!'\n\n\nYou know the song, perhaps?\"\n\n\"I've heard something like it,\" said Alice.\n\n\"It goes on, you know,\" the Hatter continued, \"in this way: -- \n\n'Up above the world you fly,\nLike a tea-tray in the sky.\n Twinkle, twinkle -- '\"\n\n\nHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep\n\"_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_ -- \" and went on so long that they\nhad to pinch it to make it stop.\n\n\"Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,\" said the Hatter, \"when the\nQueen jumped up and bawled out, 'He's murdering the time! Off with his\nhead!'\"\n\n\"How dreadfully savage!\" exclaimed Alice.\n\n\"And ever since that,\" the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, \"he won't\ndo a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.\"\n\nA bright idea came into Alice's head. \"Is that the reason so many\ntea-things are put out here?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes, that's it,\" said the Hatter with a sigh: \"it's always tea-time,\nand we've no time to wash the things between whiles.\"\n\n\"Then you keep moving round, I suppose?\" said Alice.\n\n\"Exactly so,\" said the Hatter: \"as the things get used up.\"\n\n\"But what happens when you come to the beginning again?\" Alice ventured\nto ask.\n\n\"Suppose we change the subject,\" the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\n\"I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I don't know one,\" said Alice, rather alarmed at the\nproposal.\n\n\"Then the Dormouse shall!\" they both cried. \"Wake up, Dormouse!\" And\nthey pinched it on both sides at once.\n\nThe Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. \"I wasn't asleep,\" he said in a\nhoarse, feeble voice: \"I heard every word you fellows were saying.\"\n\n\"Tell us a story!\" said the March Hare.\n\n\"Yes, please do!\" pleaded Alice.\n\n\"And be quick about it,\" added the Hatter, \"or you'll be asleep again\nbefore it's done.\"\n\n\"Once upon a time there were three little sisters,\" the Dormouse began\nin a great hurry; \"and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\nthey lived at the bottom of a well -- \"\n\n\"What did they live on?\" said Alice, who always took a great interest\nin questions of eating and drinking.\n\n\"They lived on treacle,\" said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\ntwo.\n\n\"They couldn't have done that, you know,\" Alice gently remarked;\n\"they'd have been ill.\"\n\n\"So they were,\" said the Dormouse; \"_very_ ill.\"\n\nAlice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary way of\nliving would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: \"But\nwhy did they live at the bottom of a well?\"\n\n\"Take some more tea,\" the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\n\n\"I've had nothing yet,\" Alice replied in an offended tone, \"so I can't\ntake more.\"\n\n\"You mean you can't take _less_,\" said the Hatter: \"it's very easy to\ntake _more_ than nothing.\"\n\n\"Nobody asked _your_ opinion,\" said Alice.\n\n\"Who's making personal remarks now?\" the Hatter asked triumphantly.\n\nAlice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to\nsome tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\nrepeated her question. \"Why did they live at the bottom of a well?\"\n\nThe Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\nsaid, \"It was a treacle-well.\"\n\n\"There's no such thing!\" Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\nHatter and the March Hare went \"Sh! sh!\" and the Dormouse sulkily\nremarked, \"If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for\nyourself.\"\n\n\"No, please go on!\" Alice said very humbly; \"I won't interrupt again. I\ndare say there may be _one_.\"\n\n\"One, indeed!\" said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\ngo on. \"And so these three little sisters -- they were learning to draw,\nyou know -- \"\n\n\"What did they draw?\" said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\n\n\"Treacle,\" said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\n\n\"I want a clean cup,\" interrupted the Hatter: \"let's all move one place\non.\"\n\nHe moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\nmoved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the\nplace of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\nadvantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\nbefore, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\n\nAlice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\ncautiously: \"But I don't understand. Where did they draw the treacle\nfrom?\"\n\n\"You can draw water out of a water-well,\" said the Hatter; \"so I should\nthink you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well -- eh, stupid?\"\n\n\"But they were _in_ the well,\" Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing\nto notice this last remark.\n\n\"Of course they were,\" said the Dormouse; \" -- well in.\"\n\nThis answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\nsome time without interrupting it.\n\n\"They were learning to draw,\" the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\nits eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; \"and they drew all manner of\nthings -- everything that begins with an M -- \"\n\n\"Why with an M?\" said Alice.\n\n\"Why not?\" said the March Hare.\n\nAlice was silent.\n\nThe Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a\ndoze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a\nlittle shriek, and went on: \" -- that begins with an M, such as\nmouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness -- you know you say\nthings are \"much of a muchness\" -- did you ever see such a thing as a\ndrawing of a muchness?\"\n\n\"Really, now you ask me,\" said Alice, very much confused, \"I don't\nthink -- \"\n\n\"Then you shouldn't talk,\" said the Hatter.\n\nThis piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\ngreat disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\nneither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\nlooked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\nthe last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\nthe teapot.\n\n\"At any rate I'll never go _there_ again!\" said Alice as she picked her\nway through the wood. \"It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in\nall my life!\"\n\nJust as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door\nleading right into it. \"That's very curious!\" she thought. \"But\neverything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.\" And\nin she went.\n\nOnce more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little\nglass table. \"Now, I'll manage better this time,\" she said to herself,\nand began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that\nled into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom\n(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot\nhigh: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_ -- she found\nherself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds\nand the cool fountains."
