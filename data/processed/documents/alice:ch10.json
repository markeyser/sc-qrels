  "text": "The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across\nhis eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or\ntwo sobs choked his voice. \"Same as if he had a bone in his throat,\"\nsaid the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\nthe back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\nrunning down his cheeks, he went on again: -- \n\n\"You may not have lived much under the sea -- \" (\"I haven't,\" said\nAlice) -- \"and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster -- \"\n(Alice began to say \"I once tasted -- \" but checked herself hastily, and\nsaid \"No, never\") \" -- so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a\nLobster Quadrille is!\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" said Alice. \"What sort of a dance is it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" said the Gryphon, \"you first form into a line along the\nsea-shore -- \"\n\n\"Two lines!\" cried the Mock Turtle. \"Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;\nthen, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way -- \"\n\n\"_That_ generally takes some time,\" interrupted the Gryphon.\n\n\" -- you advance twice -- \"\n\n\"Each with a lobster as a partner!\" cried the Gryphon.\n\n\"Of course,\" the Mock Turtle said: \"advance twice, set to partners -- \"\n\n\" -- change lobsters, and retire in same order,\" continued the Gryphon.\n\n\"Then, you know,\" the Mock Turtle went on, \"you throw the -- \"\n\n\"The lobsters!\" shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\n\n\" -- as far out to sea as you can -- \"\n\n\"Swim after them!\" screamed the Gryphon.\n\n\"Turn a somersault in the sea!\" cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly\nabout.\n\n\"Change lobsters again!\" yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.\n\n\"Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,\" said the Mock\nTurtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had\nbeen jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very\nsadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.\n\n\"It must be a very pretty dance,\" said Alice timidly.\n\n\"Would you like to see a little of it?\" said the Mock Turtle.\n\n\"Very much indeed,\" said Alice.\n\n\"Come, let's try the first figure!\" said the Mock Turtle to the\nGryphon. \"We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?\"\n\n\"Oh, _you_ sing,\" said the Gryphon. \"I've forgotten the words.\"\n\nSo they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and\nthen treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\nforepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly\nand sadly: -- \n\n\"Will you walk a little faster?\" said a whiting to a snail.\n\"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail.\nSee how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!\nThey are waiting on the shingle -- will you come and join the dance?\nWill you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?\nWill you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?\n\n\"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be\nWhen they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!\"\nBut the snail replied \"Too far, too far!\" and gave a look askance -- \nSaid he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.\n\n\"What matters it how far we go?\" his scaly friend replied.\n\"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.\nThe further off from England the nearer is to France -- \nThen turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.\nWill you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?\nWill you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?\"\n\n\n\"Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,\" said Alice,\nfeeling very glad that it was over at last: \"and I do so like that\ncurious song about the whiting!\"\n\n\"Oh, as to the whiting,\" said the Mock Turtle, \"they -- you've seen them,\nof course?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Alice, \"I've often seen them at dinn -- \" she checked herself\nhastily.\n\n\"I don't know where Dinn may be,\" said the Mock Turtle, \"but if you've\nseen them so often, of course you know what they're like.\"\n\n\"I believe so,\" Alice replied thoughtfully. \"They have their tails in\ntheir mouths -- and they're all over crumbs.\"\n\n\"You're wrong about the crumbs,\" said the Mock Turtle: \"crumbs would\nall wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;\nand the reason is -- \" here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his\neyes. -- \"Tell her about the reason and all that,\" he said to the Gryphon.\n\n\"The reason is,\" said the Gryphon, \"that they _would_ go with the\nlobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to\nfall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they\ncouldn't get them out again. That's all.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Alice, \"it's very interesting. I never knew so much\nabout a whiting before.\"\n\n\"I can tell you more than that, if you like,\" said the Gryphon. \"Do you\nknow why it's called a whiting?\"\n\n\"I never thought about it,\" said Alice. \"Why?\"\n\n\"_It does the boots and shoes_,\" the Gryphon replied very solemnly.\n\nAlice was thoroughly puzzled. \"Does the boots and shoes!\" she repeated\nin a wondering tone.\n\n\"Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?\" said the Gryphon. \"I mean, what\nmakes them so shiny?\"\n\nAlice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\nanswer. \"They're done with blacking, I believe.\"\n\n\"Boots and shoes under the sea,\" the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,\n\"are done with a whiting. Now you know.\"\n\n\"And what are they made of?\" Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.\n\n\"Soles and eels, of course,\" the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:\n\"any shrimp could have told you that.\"\n\n\"If I'd been the whiting,\" said Alice, whose thoughts were still\nrunning on the song, \"I'd have said to the porpoise, 'Keep back,\nplease: we don't want _you_ with us!'\"\n\n\"They were obliged to have him with them,\" the Mock Turtle said: \"no\nwise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't it really?\" said Alice in a tone of great surprise.\n\n\"Of course not,\" said the Mock Turtle: \"why, if a fish came to _me_,\nand told me he was going a journey, I should say 'With what porpoise?'\"\n\n\"Don't you mean 'purpose'?\" said Alice.\n\n\"I mean what I say,\" the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And\nthe Gryphon added \"Come, let's hear some of _your_ adventures.\"\n\n\"I could tell you my adventures -- beginning from this morning,\" said\nAlice a little timidly: \"but it's no use going back to yesterday,\nbecause I was a different person then.\"\n\n\"Explain all that,\" said the Mock Turtle.\n\n\"No, no! The adventures first,\" said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:\n\"explanations take such a dreadful time.\"\n\nSo Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\nsaw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,\nthe two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\ntheir eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she\nwent on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part\nabout her repeating \"_You are old, Father William_,\" to the\nCaterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock\nTurtle drew a long breath, and said \"That's very curious.\"\n\n\"It's all about as curious as it can be,\" said the Gryphon.\n\n\"It all came different!\" the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. \"I\nshould like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to\nbegin.\" He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of\nauthority over Alice.\n\n\"Stand up and repeat ''_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,'\" said the\nGryphon.\n\n\"How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!\"\nthought Alice; \"I might as well be at school at once.\" However, she got\nup, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster\nQuadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came\nvery queer indeed: -- \n\n\"'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\n\"You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.\"\nAs a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\nTrims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.\"\n\n[later editions continued as follows\nWhen the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,\nAnd will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\nBut, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\nHis voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]\n\n\n\"That's different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,\" said\nthe Gryphon.\n\n\"Well, I never heard it before,\" said the Mock Turtle; \"but it sounds\nuncommon nonsense.\"\n\nAlice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,\nwondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.\n\n\"I should like to have it explained,\" said the Mock Turtle.\n\n\"She can't explain it,\" said the Gryphon hastily. \"Go on with the next\nverse.\"\n\n\"But about his toes?\" the Mock Turtle persisted. \"How _could_ he turn\nthem out with his nose, you know?\"\n\n\"It's the first position in dancing.\" Alice said; but was dreadfully\npuzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.\n\n\"Go on with the next verse,\" the Gryphon repeated impatiently: \"it\nbegins '_I passed by his garden_.'\"\n\nAlice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come\nwrong, and she went on in a trembling voice: -- \n\n\"I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,\nHow the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie -- \"\n\n[later editions continued as follows\nThe Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,\nWhile the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.\nWhen the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,\nWas kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:\nWhile the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,\nAnd concluded the banquet -- ]\n\n\n\"What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,\" the Mock Turtle\ninterrupted, \"if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far the\nmost confusing thing _I_ ever heard!\"\n\n\"Yes, I think you'd better leave off,\" said the Gryphon: and Alice was\nonly too glad to do so.\n\n\"Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?\" the Gryphon\nwent on. \"Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?\"\n\n\"Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,\" Alice\nreplied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,\n\"Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her '_Turtle Soup_,' will you, old\nfellow?\"\n\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked\nwith sobs, to sing this: -- \n\n\"Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,\nWaiting in a hot tureen!\nWho for such dainties would not stoop?\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\n Beau -- ootiful Soo -- oop!\n Beau -- ootiful Soo -- oop!\nSoo -- oop of the e -- e -- evening,\n Beautiful, beautiful Soup!\n\n\"Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,\nGame, or any other dish?\nWho would not give all else for two p\nennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\nPennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\n Beau -- ootiful Soo -- oop!\n Beau -- ootiful Soo -- oop!\nSoo -- oop of the e -- e -- evening,\n Beautiful, beauti -- FUL SOUP!\"\n\n\n\"Chorus again!\" cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun\nto repeat it, when a cry of \"The trial's beginning!\" was heard in the\ndistance.\n\n\"Come on!\" cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried\noff, without waiting for the end of the song.\n\n\"What trial is it?\" Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only\nanswered \"Come on!\" and ran the faster, while more and more faintly\ncame, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words: -- \n\n\"Soo -- oop of the e -- e -- evening,\n Beautiful, beautiful Soup!\""
