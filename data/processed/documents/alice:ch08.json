  "text": "A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses\ngrowing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\npainting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she\nwent nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard\none of them say, \"Look out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me\nlike that!\"\n\n\"I couldn't help it,\" said Five, in a sulky tone; \"Seven jogged my\nelbow.\"\n\nOn which Seven looked up and said, \"That's right, Five! Always lay the\nblame on others!\"\n\n\"_You'd_ better not talk!\" said Five. \"I heard the Queen say only\nyesterday you deserved to be beheaded!\"\n\n\"What for?\" said the one who had spoken first.\n\n\"That's none of _your_ business, Two!\" said Seven.\n\n\"Yes, it _is_ his business!\" said Five, \"and I'll tell him -- it was for\nbringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.\"\n\nSeven flung down his brush, and had just begun \"Well, of all the unjust\nthings -- \" when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching\nthem, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,\nand all of them bowed low.\n\n\"Would you tell me,\" said Alice, a little timidly, \"why you are\npainting those roses?\"\n\nFive and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low\nvoice, \"Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a\n_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen\nwas to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So\nyou see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to -- \" At this\nmoment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\nout \"The Queen! The Queen!\" and the three gardeners instantly threw\nthemselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,\nand Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.\n\nFirst came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the\nthree gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\ncorners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\ndiamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came\nthe royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\njumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all\nornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,\nand among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a\nhurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went\nby without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying\nthe King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\ngrand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\n\nAlice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\nlike the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\nof such a rule at processions; \"and besides, what would be the use of a\nprocession,\" thought she, \"if people had all to lie down upon their\nfaces, so that they couldn't see it?\" So she stood still where she was,\nand waited.\n\nWhen the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\nat her, and the Queen said severely \"Who is this?\" She said it to the\nKnave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\n\n\"Idiot!\" said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\nAlice, she went on, \"What's your name, child?\"\n\n\"My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,\" said Alice very politely;\nbut she added, to herself, \"Why, they're only a pack of cards, after\nall. I needn't be afraid of them!\"\n\n\"And who are _these?_\" said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners\nwho were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on\ntheir faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of\nthe pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,\nor courtiers, or three of her own children.\n\n\"How should _I_ know?\" said Alice, surprised at her own courage. \"It's\nno business of _mine_.\"\n\nThe Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\nmoment like a wild beast, screamed \"Off with her head! Off -- \"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\nsilent.\n\nThe King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said \"Consider, my\ndear: she is only a child!\"\n\nThe Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave \"Turn\nthem over!\"\n\nThe Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\n\n\"Get up!\" said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three\ngardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,\nthe royal children, and everybody else.\n\n\"Leave off that!\" screamed the Queen. \"You make me giddy.\" And then,\nturning to the rose-tree, she went on, \"What _have_ you been doing\nhere?\"\n\n\"May it please your Majesty,\" said Two, in a very humble tone, going\ndown on one knee as he spoke, \"we were trying -- \"\n\n\"_I_ see!\" said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.\n\"Off with their heads!\" and the procession moved on, three of the\nsoldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran\nto Alice for protection.\n\n\"You shan't be beheaded!\" said Alice, and she put them into a large\nflower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a\nminute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the\nothers.\n\n\"Are their heads off?\" shouted the Queen.\n\n\"Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!\" the soldiers shouted\nin reply.\n\n\"That's right!\" shouted the Queen. \"Can you play croquet?\"\n\nThe soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was\nevidently meant for her.\n\n\"Yes!\" shouted Alice.\n\n\"Come on, then!\" roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,\nwondering very much what would happen next.\n\n\"It's -- it's a very fine day!\" said a timid voice at her side. She was\nwalking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\n\n\"Very,\" said Alice: \" -- where's the Duchess?\"\n\n\"Hush! Hush!\" said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked\nanxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\ntiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered \"She's under\nsentence of execution.\"\n\n\"What for?\" said Alice.\n\n\"Did you say 'What a pity!'?\" the Rabbit asked.\n\n\"No, I didn't,\" said Alice: \"I don't think it's at all a pity. I said\n'What for?'\"\n\n\"She boxed the Queen's ears -- \" the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little\nscream of laughter. \"Oh, hush!\" the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\ntone. \"The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the\nQueen said -- \"\n\n\"Get to your places!\" shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\npeople began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\nother; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\nbegan. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground\nin her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live\nhedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double\nthemselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\n\nThe chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\nshe succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,\nunder her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she\nhad got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the\nhedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look\nup in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help\nbursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was\ngoing to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog\nhad unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all\nthis, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\nwanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were\nalways getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice\nsoon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\n\nThe players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\nall the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time\nthe Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\nshouting \"Off with his head!\" or \"Off with her head!\" about once in a\nminute.\n\nAlice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\ndispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\n\"and then,\" thought she, \"what would become of me? They're dreadfully\nfond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any\none left alive!\"\n\nShe was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\ncould get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious\nappearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after\nwatching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said\nto herself \"It's the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk\nto.\"\n\n\"How are you getting on?\" said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\nenough for it to speak with.\n\nAlice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. \"It's no use\nspeaking to it,\" she thought, \"till its ears have come, or at least one\nof them.\" In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\ndown her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\nshe had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there\nwas enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\n\n\"I don't think they play at all fairly,\" Alice began, in rather a\ncomplaining tone, \"and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear\noneself speak -- and they don't seem to have any rules in particular; at\nleast, if there are, nobody attends to them -- and you've no idea how\nconfusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the\narch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\nground -- and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only\nit ran away when it saw mine coming!\"\n\n\"How do you like the Queen?\" said the Cat in a low voice.\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Alice: \"she's so extremely -- \" Just then she noticed\nthat the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\n\" -- likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.\"\n\nThe Queen smiled and passed on.\n\n\"Who _are_ you talking to?\" said the King, going up to Alice, and\nlooking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.\n\n\"It's a friend of mine -- a Cheshire Cat,\" said Alice: \"allow me to\nintroduce it.\"\n\n\"I don't like the look of it at all,\" said the King: \"however, it may\nkiss my hand if it likes.\"\n\n\"I'd rather not,\" the Cat remarked.\n\n\"Don't be impertinent,\" said the King, \"and don't look at me like\nthat!\" He got behind Alice as he spoke.\n\n\"A cat may look at a king,\" said Alice. \"I've read that in some book,\nbut I don't remember where.\"\n\n\"Well, it must be removed,\" said the King very decidedly, and he called\nthe Queen, who was passing at the moment, \"My dear! I wish you would\nhave this cat removed!\"\n\nThe Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or\nsmall. \"Off with his head!\" she said, without even looking round.\n\n\"I'll fetch the executioner myself,\" said the King eagerly, and he\nhurried off.\n\nAlice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\non, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with\npassion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\nexecuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\nof things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\nwhether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\n\nThe hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\nto Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\nother: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to\nthe other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a\nhelpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.\n\nBy the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\nwas over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: \"but it doesn't\nmatter much,\" thought Alice, \"as all the arches are gone from this side\nof the ground.\" So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\nescape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\nfriend.\n\nWhen she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite\na large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\nthe executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\nwhile all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\n\nThe moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\nthe question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\nall spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\nwhat they said.\n\nThe executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless\nthere was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a\nthing before, and he wasn't going to begin at _his_ time of life.\n\nThe King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be\nbeheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.\n\nThe Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in\nless than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round. (It was\nthis last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and\nanxious.)\n\nAlice could think of nothing else to say but \"It belongs to the\nDuchess: you'd better ask _her_ about it.\"\n\n\"She's in prison,\" the Queen said to the executioner: \"fetch her here.\"\nAnd the executioner went off like an arrow.\n\nThe Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the\ntime he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so\nthe King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,\nwhile the rest of the party went back to the game."
